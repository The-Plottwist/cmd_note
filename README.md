# What is it:

A text interpreter for windows command line ***cmd/powershell***.

# Why did you made such a thing:

I had free time and was looking for a project then this happened. ;)

# Usage:

It's pretty straightforward. Just run the program.

# Bugs:

Until recently Windows 10 (which was the only one btw.) was supporting Utf-8 command ```CHCP 65001```. <u>But now it makes the program crash.</u>
